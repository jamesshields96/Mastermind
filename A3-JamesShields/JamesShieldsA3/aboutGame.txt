Alright, here's the plan. We are trying to break into the bank vault. 
It's got a 4 letter code that changes after every lockout to make this even harder for us.
Be careful what you put in, after 12 guesses the alarm will go off and the police will get involved. 
Take your time and think about what it the code can be. 
Our programs can learn if you get one part of the code right so use that knowledge with each attempt. 
Do not go guessing randomly else we will both be behind bars tonight. 
Once you start, you have 20 minutes to get in else the alarms will be alerted. 
The faster you get in, the bigger cut of the pay i'll give you. 
Good luck and do NOT screw this up.
